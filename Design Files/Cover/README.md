## Design

The cover is more aesthetics than anything, however it is helpful in reducing the amount of dust and debris that will get into the linear rail which needs to stay clean and lubricated.

## 3D Printing

The cover is designed to be 3d printed, it could be CNC machined as well, although it would probably not be super easy and/or cheap.  If it were to be CNC machined however, there are a lot of areas that could be simplified or adjusted with drill taps to eliminate the use of some hardware.

### Material Options

I’ve only tested this part printed in [Fiberon's PETG-CF](https://a.co/d/dX2OyLc).

The **Cover** is not structural and does not need to be printed in nylon.

### Print Settings

The slider was printed on a Creality K2 Plus, but print settings will vary depending on your printer and material.

**⚠️ Note:** The main body of the enclosure is just over **280mm wide** and may not fit on most printers. I’ve included a split version that should work on smaller beds. I haven’t tested it personally, but it should print the same.

#### Recommended Print Settings

- **Wall loops**: At least 3
- **Top layers**: 4
- **Bottom layers**: 3
- **Infill**: 15% sparse gyroid
- **If using rectangular infill**: Use 20% or higher

## Hardware

The hardware I used can mostly be sourced from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/).  
If you're substituting parts from your local hardware store or Amazon, be sure to double-check dimensions — they're critical for fit and function.
