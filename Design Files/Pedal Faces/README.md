## Design

The pedal faces are designed to match my existing dead pedal and heel plate from [Pedal Haus](http://www.pedalhaus.com), which produces pedals and accessories for most BMW models.  
Each pedal face consists of **three parts**: the faceplate, the mounting bracket, and a cosmetic beauty ring.

There are three pedal faces in total: **throttle**, **brake**, and **clutch**. The faceplates for the throttle and brake are identical, but the **mounting brackets for the brake and clutch differ slightly**. This difference ensures that when all three pedal assemblies are mounted equidistant from one another, the spacing between pedals remains visually and functionally consistent.

If you're building only a throttle and brake pedal setup, you can choose either the **brake** or **clutch** bracket for the brake pedal. The **clutch bracket** increases the spacing between the pedals, while the **brake bracket** decreases it.  
Which one you use is entirely a matter of personal preference.

## 3D Printing

These parts are designed for 3D printing, though the faceplates are one of the few components that could benefit significantly from being **CNC machined** for a more polished and professional finish. I eventually plan to machine and anodize mine to match the rest of my Pedal Haus components.

### Material Options

The pedal face has been tested with [Fiberon's PPS-CF](https://a.co/d/0nK6oxm), though it should also work well with eSun’s [ePA-CF](https://a.co/d/0XDH10W).

- **Pedal Mount**: Should be printed in ePA-CF, but PETG-CF is also acceptable.
- **Beauty Ring**: Can be printed in any material — this part is purely cosmetic. I've tested both PLA and PETG, ultimately using PETG due to color preference.

While PPS offers **high temperature resistance** and exceptional stiffness, nylon tends to flex under load. A stiffer material ensures that the pedal feels as rigid and responsive as possible, even though it’s made from plastic.

### Print Settings

The pedal face was printed on a Creality K2 Plus, but your settings may vary based on printer and material.

#### Recommended Print Settings

- **Wall loops**: At least 10
- **Top layers**: 12
- **Bottom layers**: 10
- **Infill**: 30% sparse gyroid
- **If using rectangular infill**: Use 40% or higher

⚠️ For PPS / Nylon:  
Make sure to thoroughly dry your filament before printing. Even slightly damp material will result in poor print quality, weak adhesion, and reduced strength.

## Hardware

Most hardware is sourced from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/).  
If substituting from Amazon or local hardware stores, double-check dimensions — tolerances here matter.

The required hardware is the same regardless of which pedal variation you're building.

### Notes

1. **12mm Screws** – Screw length is important. A 10mm length may work, but anything longer than 12mm may prevent the faceplate from seating securely.
