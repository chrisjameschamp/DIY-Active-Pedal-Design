## Design

This is the second design iteration of the Pedal Arm. The first version had mounting brackets approximately 25mm lower, which increased travel but reduced usable servo force. Since that much travel isn‚Äôt necessary, I moved the brackets upward ‚Äî nearly doubling the effective braking force the servos can handle.

## 3D Printing

The arm is designed to be 3d printed, it could be CNC machined as well, although it would probably not be super easy and/or cheap.  If it were to be CNC machined however, there are a lot of areas that could be simplified or adjusted with drill taps to eliminate the use of some hardware.

### Material Options

I‚Äôve only tested this part printed in eSun‚Äôs [ePA-CF](https://a.co/d/0XDH10W), an 80/20 nylon-carbon fiber composite with excellent strength, layer adhesion, and added rigidity from the carbon fiber. It also has relatively high tensile strength.

You could try pure nylon, although it might be too flexible.

More affordable options like PETG+CF or ABS+CF composites may work as well. While they likely have enough strength in the XY axis (which is how the part is oriented for printing), I‚Äôm less confident in their Z-axis strength due to weaker layer bonding.

Some users in the DIY FFB Pedal Discord have reported success with PLA+ or regular PETG. I haven‚Äôt tested these myself, and I‚Äôd be cautious about PLA+‚Äôs long-term durability.

### Print Settings

The pedal arm was printed on a Creality K2 Plus, but print settings will vary depending on your printer and material. Make sure your filament and printer are well-tuned before attempting a full print ‚Äî it‚Äôs a large part and can take quite a while.

Don‚Äôt do what I did and print seven of them while dialing in settings üòÖ

#### Recommended Print Settings

- **Wall loops**: At least 10
- **Top layers**: 12
- **Bottom layers**: 10
- **Infill**: 30% sparse gyroid
- **If using rectangular infill**: Use 40% or higher

‚ö†Ô∏è For nylon:
Thoroughly dry your filament before printing. Even slightly damp nylon will print poorly, resulting in weak layer adhesion and rough surface quality.

Due to the high wall/infill density, use a brim (10mm recommended) and possibly glue stick or other adhesion aid. I used both, and they were necessary to prevent warping.

## Hardware

The hardware I used can almost all be sourced from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/), which I know can be a little pricey at times, so if you are swapping out individual hardware from your local hardware store, or Amazon, etc.  Double check dimensions as they are critical for the overall assembly, fitment, and strength of the part.
