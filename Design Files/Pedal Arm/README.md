## Design

This is the second design iteration of the Pedal Arm. The first version had mounting brackets approximately 25mm lower, which increased travel but reduced usable servo force. Since that much travel isn‚Äôt necessary, I moved the brackets upward ‚Äî nearly doubling the effective braking force the servos can handle.

## 3D Printing

The arm is designed to be 3d printed, it could be CNC machined as well, although it would probably not be super easy and/or cheap.  If it were to be CNC machined however, there are a lot of areas that could be simplified or adjusted with drill taps to eliminate the use of some hardware.

### Material Options

I‚Äôve only tested this part printed in eSun‚Äôs [ePA-CF](https://a.co/d/0XDH10W), an 80/20 nylon-carbon fiber composite with excellent strength, layer adhesion, and added rigidity from the carbon fiber. It also has relatively high tensile strength.

You could try pure nylon, although it might be too flexible.

More affordable options like PETG+CF or ABS+CF composites may work as well. While they likely have enough strength in the XY axis (which is how the part is oriented for printing), I‚Äôm less confident in their Z-axis strength due to weaker layer bonding.

Some users in the DIY FFB Pedal Discord have reported success with PLA+ or regular PETG. I haven‚Äôt tested these myself, and I‚Äôd be cautious about PLA+‚Äôs long-term durability.

### Print Settings

The pedal arm was printed on a Creality K2 Plus, but print settings will vary depending on your printer and material. Make sure your filament and printer are well-tuned before attempting a full print ‚Äî it‚Äôs a large part and can take quite a while.

Don‚Äôt do what I did and print seven of them while dialing in settings üòÖ

#### Recommended Print Settings

- **Wall loops**: At least 10
- **Top layers**: 12
- **Bottom layers**: 10
- **Infill**: 30% sparse gyroid
- **If using rectangular infill**: Use 40% or higher

‚ö†Ô∏è For nylon:
Thoroughly dry your filament before printing. Even slightly damp nylon will print poorly, resulting in weak layer adhesion and rough surface quality.

Due to the high wall/infill density, use a brim (10mm recommended) and possibly glue stick or other adhesion aid. I used both, and they were necessary to prevent warping.

## Hardware

The hardware I used can mostly be sourced from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/).  
If you're substituting parts from your local hardware store or Amazon, be sure to double-check dimensions ‚Äî they're critical for fit and function.

### Notes

1. **M8 Socket Head Bolts** ‚Äì I originally designed for low-profile socket heads, but ended up using **pan head bolts** with the same dimensions due to cost.
2. **8mm OD Spacer** ‚Äì This needs to be **tapped on both sides** for M5x0.8 threads.
3. **M5x0.8 25mm Threaded Rod** ‚Äì Depending on the depth of your binding post screws, you may want a **shorter version**. These worked well with the ones linked above.
4. **Binding Post Screws** ‚Äì These were sourced from Amazon; they do not have a McMaster part number.
