## What Makes These Pedals Different?

Traditional sim racing pedals use springs, rubber dampers, or load cells to simulate resistance. This project takes things further by using a high-torque servo motor and a linear rail system to deliver real, programmable force feedback directly through the pedal.

What does that mean in practice?

- Feel ABS lockup through the brake pedal  
- Experience throttle kick during gear shifts or traction loss  
- Sense road texture and bumps through the pedal face  
- Adjust pedal weight, travel, and pressure curves entirely in software  
- Create and switch between custom pedal profiles for different cars

These pedals don’t just measure your input — they push back, dynamically responding to what’s happening in the simulation. Whether you’re locking up into a braking zone or driving over rumble strips, the pedals provide responsive, physical feedback.

If you're aiming to build a sim racing setup that closely mirrors a real race car experience, this project is designed to help you get there.
